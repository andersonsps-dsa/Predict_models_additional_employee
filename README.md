# 📊 Predictive Models with OLS & Poisson Regression

Welcome to the **Predictive Models** project! This repository contains a demonstration of predictive modeling using **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** and **Poisson regression**. The data used in this project is **fictitious** and meant solely for educational purposes.

## 🚨 Important Notes:
1. **Fictitious Data**: The dataset included in this project is entirely fictional. It has been generated for the purpose of showcasing predictive modeling techniques and should not be used for any real-world decision-making.

2. **Model Validation**: To achieve better predictions, it is crucial to perform statistical tests and validations between the models. This will help determine which model is more suitable for the given data and problem context. 🚀

## 🔍 Overview:
- **OLS Model**: Typically used for predicting continuous outcomes.
- **Poisson Model**: Ideal for predicting count data or events that occur over a fixed period.
